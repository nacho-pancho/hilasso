<h2>mdoc</h2>

<p>mdoc is a little tool that automatically creates documentation for
Matlab m-files, inspired by tools like Java's javadoc feature. mdoc
analyzes the dependencies between various
m-files and then displays them as a graph like the one below,
or as a system of HTML files like the one you are looking at.
The graphical representation is a GUI; if you open it
with Matlab, you can click on the names of modules, and their
help strings will appear in Matlab's help window.</p>

<p>There exists another Matlab documentation tool,
<a href="http://ocamaweb.sf.net/">Ocamaweb</a>. Ocamaweb and mdoc are
basically orthogonal to each other; Ocamaweb creates detailed documentation
for a single m-file, while mdoc provides a good overview of a package
consisting of many m-files. You can easily tie Ocamaweb's output into
HTML files generated by mdoc. The necessary code is below.</p>

<p>If you want to use mdoc, simply download the file
<a href="mdoc.zip">mdoc.zip</a> and unpack it in some directory that
should be included in Matlab's path. In order to see mdoc in action,
start Matlab and cd into your mdoc directory, then type
<kbd>makefig({'makefig','makehtml'});</kbd> at the Matlab
prompt. The function that creates HTML documentation is called
<code>makehtml</code>.
</p>

A few comments:
<ul>
<li>If you would like to see a rather complex example of mdoc in action,
look at the documentation page of <a href="/iode/">Iode</a>.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, mdoc does not work with
<a href="http://www.octave.org/">Octave</a> because the computation
of dependency graphs hinges on the command <code>depfun</code>, which
Octave doesn't know.</li>
<li>mdoc's HTML output is meant to be used with <!-- _GP_ version -->.
Like this, the complexity of mdoc's HTML generator is minimal, but one
can still control the layout via Genpage.</li>
<li>The layout generator for graph representations starts with a random
placement of vertices, and if you're unhappy with the result, you may
try again, hoping to reach a better layout from a different starting
position.</li>
<li>mdoc is available under the
<a href= "http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependency graph for mdoc</h3>
<!-- _GP_ img("mdoc.jpg","mdoc dependency diagram") -->

<h3>A typical template file for mdoc and Genpage</h3>
<!-- _GP_ displayHTML(include("layout/template.html")) -->
<p>If you want to tie a PDF file generated by Ocamaweb into mdoc's HTML
code, you can add a link like the following one to your template file:</p>
<!-- _GP_ displayHTML(include("include/ocamaweblink.html")) -->
