% function I=depatchify(M,N,X,overlap,DC)
% 
% purpose: 
% reconstruct an image from a set of patches
%
% input:
% M ........ width of image
% N ........ height of image
% X ........ set of square w*w patches (with DC removed)
% overlap ..length of overlapping region
% DC ....... vector of DC coefficients of the patches in X
%
% output:
% I ........ depatchified image
